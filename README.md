# ⛷ Ski Resorts Data Analysis with Power BI  
### First Experience with DAX and a Winter-Themed Dashboard!

In this project, I explored a cool dataset about ski resorts.  
But what made it really special?

> It was my **first time using DAX** in Power BI!

## 🧹 Step 1: Data Cleaning

As usual, the process started with cleaning the data:

- Loaded the CSV file using **Pandas**
- Removed **unnecessary columns**
- Dropped **duplicate rows** and **missing values** using `drop_duplicates()` and `dropna()`
- Exported a clean Excel file to use in Power BI

---

## 📊 Step 2: Building the Dashboard in Power BI

This is where the fun started!  
I created a **professional Power BI dashboard** and got hands-on with **DAX** for the first time.

Using DAX, I performed calculations such as:

- **Average reservation price**
- **Percentage of resorts with night skiing**
- **Percentage of resorts open in summer**

## 🎨 Dashboard Visuals Overview

### ✅ 5 KPI Cards

Each card displays a key insight from the dataset:

1. **Total number of ski resorts**
2. **Average reservation price** → `$48.72`
3. **% of resorts with night skiing** → `~59%`
4. **% of resorts open in summer** → `~5.8%`
5. **Average vertical drop** → `960 meters`

### 📊 Column Chart  
**Comparison of continents by number of lifts and average price**

- **Europe** has the highest number of lifts
- **North America** has the highest average price

> Expensive doesn’t always mean better!

### 🗺️ Global Map  
Shows the **distribution of ski resorts by country**

Top countries include:

- France  
- USA  
- Austria  
- Switzerland

### 🍩 Donut Chart – Night Skiing

- **~59%** of resorts offer **night skiing**
- The rest are **day-only**

> Night skiing is more common than expected!

---

### 🍩 Donut Chart – Summer Skiing

- Only **~5.8%** of resorts operate in summer

> Making it a rare and premium experience!

## 💡 Final Thoughts

This project introduced me to **DAX**, added a new layer of depth to my Power BI skills, and helped me build a well-structured and meaningful dashboard.  
A fun and snowy ride into data analytics!
